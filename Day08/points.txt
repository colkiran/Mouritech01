write a hof which takes a function as an argument and display all the arguments passed to the function, the function can take zero or more arguments.

def fun(a, b, c, d, e)

def diff(x, y):
    return x - y

write a decorator that will always result a positive value from diff

diff(30, 10)        => 20
diff(10, 30)        => -20  => 20

sqlalchemy => ORM

File handling
-------------


text files =>   ascii format

doc or docx => encrypted ->

open a file
    a. read     - mode -> r - only read the contents of the file (default mode)

    b. write    - mode -> w - only write data into a file
                              if the file is already present, delete the contents of the file and strart writing newly into the file
                              if the file is not present then create a new file and write into the file

    c. append   -mode -> a -  only write into the file
                              if the file is already present, write the contents into the file without disturbing the previous contents
                              if the file is not present then create a new file and write into the file


Mode - Read
-----------
1. read
    a. reads the entire content of the file
    b. reads the data that is mentioned in bytes

2. readline
    a. read oneline at a time and store it in the buffer

3. readlines


move the file handle from one place to another using

seek(offset, whence)

offset => no of bytes

whence =>      0    - BOF
               1    - CP
               2    - EOF
