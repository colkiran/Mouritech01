1. python checks for .pth file in the root directory (where python.exe is present)

2. if the file is present it will include this path in library path

3. if the module is found then converts the module into its byte code and then imports the module into the current file

4. from the second time that we execute the code, python will do a small comparison between the .py and .pyc files, it expects the .pyc file to have the latest date and time of modification compared to .py file else it will convert the .py file to .pyc file assuming that there were changes in the source code.
